# NetCat--
A super basic implementation of NetCat in c++

Made this based off the netcat source code (https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/master/usr.bin/nc/) to learn about how it handles socket IO

#Usage
Server mode:
  .\ncTest (starts a server on localhost port 4444)
Connect mode:
  .\ncTest <IP> <PORT>
